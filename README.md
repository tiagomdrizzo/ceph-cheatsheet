# Ceph Cheatsheet (kind of)

This is an ongoing kinda Ceph Cheatsheet inspired by [Peter Sabaini](https://sabaini.at/pages/ceph-cheatsheet.html)'s work.

# What is up with this?

I really like Ceph, but the documentation and manpages need some improvements. Most of the time I find myself looking into the documentation and thinking "where is the example?", and the multi-level subcommands are not quite intuitive.

Ceph has a steep learning curve IHMO, so I also took the time to add a lab environment using vagrant-libvirt for quick tests.

I used a custom CentOS 7.6 box to deploy the environment. In case you're wondering how to create yours check [vagrant-boxes-kickstart](https://gitlab.com/tiagomdrizzo/vagrant-boxes-kickstart).

This document is far from ready; I'm writing it mostly in my spare time.

# Caveats

English is not my native language, there will be grammar errors. The deal is that I'm going to "fix it as I find it".
